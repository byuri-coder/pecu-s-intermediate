// This file is intended for local development with the Genkit developer UI.
// It should not import any flows directly to prevent the Genkit server
// from being bundled into the production application.
// To run your flows locally, use the Genkit CLI: `genkit start -- tsx src/ai/dev.ts`
// and then import your flows here temporarily.
